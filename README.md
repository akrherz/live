Weather.IM Live Client
======================

This hot mess was the upstream development of the "NWSChat Live" client, which 
is a XMPP web client using BOSH.  But repos have diverged at this point.

This code is provided with no-warranty, but is hopefully useful for folks looking to create their client or study how poorly an application can be constructed.

All blame for this app goes to: daryl.herzmann akrherz@iastate.edu
