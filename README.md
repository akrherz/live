IEMChat/NWSChat Live Client
===========================

This hot mess is the upstream development of the "NWSChat Live" client, which 
is a XMPP web client using BOSH.  This code is provided with no-warranty, but
is hopefully useful for folks looking to create their client or study how 
poorly an application can be constructed.

All blame for this app goes to: daryl.herzmann akrherz@gmail.com
