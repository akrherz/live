Weather.IM Live Client
======================

Many moons ago, this client was the browser based interface named NWSChat Live.
The National Weather Service (NWS) subsequently migrated to Slack and this
client became obsolete.  But the [weather.im](https://weather.im) service is
still active and this interface is used there to allow browser based access
to the XMPP chat rooms.
